# C_GitHub

this is a project that aims to teach how to use and interact with github repositories.

to get a clone of the repository on your local machine:
1- open or create the directory you want to work in.
2- open the git bash while in the chosen directory.
3- enter the command: "git clone" followed by the wanted ropository's URL,  then you should see a copy of the repository's files in your folder.
4- after you're done with all your changes, it's time to upload them to the original repo. Enter the command " git add " followed by the added or modified files.
5- enter the command " git commit " to commit the changes, followed by " -m "" " to add a message with the commit.The message must be written within the "" .
6- lastly, enter the command " git push " .

NOTE: if you got a configuration message at the " git add " or " git commit "stage, enter the following commands:
        " git config --global user.email "your_email@XXX.com" "
        " git config --global user.name "your_name" "
      and then continue as stated above.
NOTE: if " git clone " didn't work, try initializing the git inside your chosen file by entering the command " git init ".
